Paladin â€” v0.4.0
====================================

Android Dependency Manager for libraries that aren't packaged as .jar or .aar.  Paladin fells your dependencies like boss.

If you have any feedback, don't hesitate to reach out to me on Twitter [@jonathonstaff](https://twitter.com/jonathonstaff).  I'm still actively developing this, and I understand there are some limitations - this is still in alpha.

Overview
========

Paladin is designed to assist Android developers who use dependencies in their projects which aren't packaged as .jar or .aar on [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/).  This is strictly for developers using Android Studio and Gradle.  Before adding a library using Paladin, I highly recommend searching the Maven Central repositories (check out [Gradle, please](http://gradleplease.appspot.com/)), since this will often provide the best means of incorporating an external library.

That being said, uploading a library to Maven Central is no walk in the park, so developers frequently forgo the process altogether and simply host a public repo with their source code.  The [Facebook SDK for Android](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk) for example, (shame on you Facebook, you're more than capable!) isn't available on Maven Central, which forces developers to clone down and manually import the library.

Paladin works to do this for you, quite similar to [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) for Objective-C development.  An `/armory` folder is created in the root directory of your project and all Paladin libraries are stored there.


Installation
============

Run:

    $ pip install paladin

or download the source and run:

    $ python setup.py install


Usage
=====

Paladin needs orders before he can carry them out.

Create `orders`
---------------

Create a json file at the root of your project titled `orders` 

    $ vim orders
    
with the following format:

    {
      "dependencies": [
        {
          "name": "Android-SmoothSeekBar",
          "url": "https://github.com/Indatus/Android-SmoothSeekBar.git"
        },
        {
          "name": "Android-SwipeControl",
          "url": "https://github.com/Indatus/Android-SwipeControl.git"
        }
      ]
    }

Required attributes:

- `"url"` (The url to a git repo containing the dependency)

Future attributes:

- `"commit"`
- `"tag"`
- `"branch"`

If you do not specifiy `"name"` in the orders, Paladin will do so for you.


Installing Dependencies
-----------------------

    $ paladin install

You should see the progess displayed in your shell window.  Once this has completed, open Android Studio and **sync** your Gradle project.


Removing Libraries
------------------

You can remove libraries by simply removing that dependency from the `orders` and re-running:

    $ paladin install

If you wish to remove all dependencies installed by Paladin, run:

    $ paladin removeall
