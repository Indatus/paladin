R2-D2 â€” v0.3.7
====================================

Android Dependency Manager for libraries that aren't packaged as .jar or .aar.

If you have any feedback, don't hesitate to reach out to me on Twitter [@jonathonstaff](https://twitter.com/jonathonstaff).  I'm still actively developing this, and I understand there are some limitations - this is still in alpha.

Overview
========

R2-D2 is designed to assist Android developers who use dependencies in their projects which aren't packaged as .jar or .aar on [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/).  This is strictly for developers using Android Studio and Gradle.  Before adding a library using R2-D2, I highly recommend searching the Maven Central repositories (check out [Gradle, please](http://gradleplease.appspot.com/)), since this will often provide the best means of incorporating an external library.

That being said, uploading a library to Maven Central is no walk in the park, so developers frequently forgo the process altogether and simply host a public repo with their source code.  The [Facebook SDK for Android](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk) for example, (shame on you Facebook, you're more than capable!) isn't available on Maven Central, which forces developers to clone down and manually import the library.

R2-D2 works to do this for you, quite similar to [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) for Objective-C development.  A `/toolbox` folder is created in the root directory of your project and all R2-D2 libraries are stored there.


Installation
============

Run:

	$ pip install r2d2

or download the source and run:

	$ python setup.py install


Usage
=====

Currently `r2d2 install` is the only command that works.  Others will be added in time.


Create a `schematic`
-----------------

Create a json file at the root of your project titled `schematic` with the following format:

	{
		"dependencies": [
			{
				"name": "Android-SmoothSeekBar",
				"url": "https://github.com/Indatus/Android-SmoothSeekBar.git"
			},
			{
				"name": "Android-SwipeControl",
				"url": "https://github.com/Indatus/Android-SwipeControl.git"
			}
		]
	}

Required attributes:

- `"url"`

Future attributes:

- `"commit"`
- `"tag"`
- `"branch"`

If you do not specifiy `"name"` in the schematic, R2-D2 will do so for you.


Installing Dependencies
-----------------------

	$ r2d2 install


You should see the progess displayed in your shell window.  Once this has completed, open Android Studio and **sync** your Gradle project.


Removing Libraries
------------------

You can remove libraries by simply removing that dependency from the `schematic` and re-running:

	$ r2d2 install
